The traditional technique for modularization is to analyze the execution-time flow of the system and organize the system structure around each major sequential task. This technique leads to a structure which has very simple connections in control, but the connections in data tend to be complex.

Guidelins for selecting abstractions
* abstraction of resources (hardware)
* abstract characteristics of data (data structure)
* simplification via limiting information (limit information of function need to know, by introducing a new lower level)
* simplification via generalization
* system maintenance and modification (for easy maintainence and modification)
